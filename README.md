# Zomato
This project delves into the data provided by Zomato, examining various attributes such as restaurant names, locations, cuisines, average costs, ratings, and reviews. Using tools like Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib or Seaborn for visualization, the dataset is analyzed to understand trends in consumer preferences, popular cuisines in different cities, the correlation between pricing and ratings, and geographical distribution of restaurant density.

Key tasks include:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and standardizing the data for accurate analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying trends in restaurant pricing, ratings, and customer preferences.
Visualization: Using graphs and charts to represent trends such as top-rated restaurants, popular cuisines, and the distribution of restaurant types.
Insights & Recommendations: Based on the analysis, suggestions will be made to improve business decisions, such as which cuisines to focus on, what pricing models work best, and how geographical location impacts restaurant success.
